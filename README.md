# Vending machine 

This project contains three different challenges given to me for an interview.

## Part 1 - UML Design

This is a diagram that visualizes the working process of the vending machine (state machine). It uses the UML 2.0 standard and was created with LucidChart.

## Part 2 - C Project
A coin only vending machine controller written in C. 

The vending machine only accepts pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters.

Once you select your product you will have the option to choose which coin to insert and when the value of coins inserted exceeds or meets the value of the chosen product it will return your change.

You can add new products and define their price up to the max amount of 10 total products.
